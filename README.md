# lazDicom
Lazarus (Pascal) Dicom Viewer - Based on ezDicom (Chris Rorden - www.mricro.com)

Original source converted and made to work in Lazarus. This is phase 1, the second phase will be to try and move the code to classes and review the code as one uses it for alternative functions / libraries that might solve alot of logic required at time when original source was written.

Example App is buggy as it is directly from the old Delphi code and made to work, will work on a new example app when time allows
